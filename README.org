#+title: YAMS: Yet Another Media Server

@@html:<img src="https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=rogs.yams" alt="visitor badge"/>@@

This is a highly opinionated media server.

Website: [[https://yams.media][https://yams.media]]

* Description
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       280135a0-2cff-4e93-8679-7d1a6d56b7b2
:END:
This script installs the following software:
- [[https://sonarr.tv/][Sonarr]]
- [[https://radarr.video/][Radarr]]
- [[https://lidarr.audio][Lidarr]]
- [[https://readarr.com/][Readarr]]
- [[https://jellyfin.org/][Jellyfin]]
- [[https://emby.media/][Emby]]
- [[https://www.plex.tv/][Plex]]
- [[https://www.qbittorrent.org/][qBittorrent]]
- [[https://www.bazarr.media/][Bazarr]]
- [[https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr][Prowlarr]]
- [[https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun][gluetun]]
- [[https://www.portainer.io/][Portainer]]

With this combination, you can create a fully functional media server that is going to download,
categorize, subtitle and serve your favorite shows, movies, audio and books.

* Features
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0e072c32-3158-4961-869c-49920090f3d5
:END:
In no particular order:
- *Automatic shows/movies download*: Just add your shows and movies to the watch list and it should
  automatically download the files when they are available.
- *Automatic clasification and organization*: Your media files should be completely organized by default.
- *Automatic subtitles download*: Self explanatory. Your media server should automatically download
  subtitles in the languages you choose, if they are available.
- *Support for Web, Android, iOS, Android TV and whatever that can support Emby*: Since we are
  leveraging from Emby, you should be able to watch your favorite media almost anywhere.

* Dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       01577a0a-852e-481a-b9b3-791b68594f96
:END:
You need to have:
- [[https://www.docker.com/][docker]]
- [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][docker-compose]]

If you haven't installed them, don't worry! The script will attempt to run both installations (it only
works in Debian and Ubuntu!)

* Before running
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1c609bfc-4e6e-4fd8-8129-1b722fd7cda8
:END:
Before installing, make sure you have:
- *An installation location*: The script is going to ask you for a install location, but it will default
  to ~/opt/yams~. Just make sure your current user has permissions to write on the selected directory.
- *A media folder*: This is the folder where all your files are going to be downloaded and categorized. If
  you choose ~/srv/media~, the script is going to create the following folders:
  + ~/srv/media/tv~: For your TV shows
  + ~/srv/media/movies~: For your movies
  + ~/srv/media/music~: For your music
  + ~/srv/media/books~: For your books
  + ~/srv/media/downloads~: For your torrent downloads
  + ~/srv/media/blackhole~: For your torrents blackhole
- *A regular user to run and own the media files*: You shouldn't use ~root~ for this user, but I'm not
  your father, nothing is going to stop you lol
- *A VPN service (optional but STRONGLY recommended):* If you can, choose one from [[https://yams.media/advanced/vpn#official-supported-vpns][this list]]. The VPN I
  always recommend is [[https://mullvad.net/en/][Mullvad]] because:
  + They don’t require your email or information to create a new account.
  + It’s simple to configure.
  + They only have monthly subscriptions, so you can leave them whenever you want.
  + You can pay with crypto.

* To run
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a0417c61-3fd8-40a0-9385-6c5aaed37337
:END:

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/rogs/yams.git
$ cd yams
$ ./install.sh
#+end_src

And follow the instructions.


So far, I've tested this in Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9e995141-b386-4962-9842-7209bedc5651
:END:
When the script finishes installing without issues, just run:
#+begin_src
$ yams
yams - Yet Another Media Server

Usage: yams [--help|restart|stop|start]
options:
--help     displays this help message
restart    restarts yams services
stop       stops all yams services
start      starts yams services
destroy    destroy yams services so you can start from scratch
#+end_src

If you *really* wish to donate, first I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart! ❤️ Second, I
would prefer you donate to any of the projects used in this script.

They are the ones doing the real work, I just created a docker-compose file and a couple of bash scripts:

- [[https://www.linuxserver.io/donate][linuxserver.io donations page]]
- [[https://sonarr.tv/donate][Sonarr donations page]]
- [[https://radarr.video/donate][Radarr donations page]]
- [[https://opencollective.com/jellyfin][Jellyfin donations page]]
- [[https://emby.media/premiere.html][Emby premier page]] (Recommended! I personally use this service)
- [[https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/][Plex pass page]]
- [[https://www.qbittorrent.org/donate][qBittorrent donations page]]
- [[https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XHHRWXT9YB7WE&source=url][Bazarr donations page]]
